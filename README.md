# Mint

**Mint** is a transactional, single-file key-value store written in Go. It prioritizes correctness and simplicity, aiming to provide a minimal yet extensible foundation for persistent storage.

## 🧭 Motivation

Mint was created to explore how low-level storage systems work — from file structure and page management to transactions and TTL encoding. The goal is to avoid premature abstraction or optimization in favor of clarity, transparency, and a hands-on understanding of database internals.

All work is tracked through structured issues and categorized by logical components like `core`, `ttl`, or `index`. The project is intentionally kept small, inspectable, and educational.
